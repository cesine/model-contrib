model-contrib
=============

The aim of the Model-Contrib project is to provide reusable interactive visualization modules that use [model.js](https://github.com/curran/model), and also provide examples that use the modules.

Check out the [project home page](http://curran.github.io/model-contrib/) for a listing of components and examples.

## Project Structure

The project home page is an AngularJS application that shows a listing of modules and examples, and thumbnails for each example. The data that drives the application can be found in `index.json`, which is generated by the NodeJS script `generateIndex.js`. The thumbnails are generated by the Node.js script `generateThumbnails.js`, which uses PhantomJS to render the pages, and GraphicsMagick to resize them.

## Contributing

If you are working with ModelJS, please consider contributing reusable modules and examples that use them. Add modules under the `modules` directory, and examples under `examples`. 

To create a new example, make a copy of the [starter example](http://curran.github.io/model-contrib/#/examples/starter) directory under `examples`. Feel free to add more top-level Bower dependencies as needed.

For discussion, please reply to the [ModelJS thread on the D3 Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/d3-js/TB8Qz-gDDNQ), or email me directly at curran.kelleher@gmail.com . I would like to make this a collaborative effort to pool Open Source community resources for reusable visualizations, please let me know if you would like to work with me on this. Feel free to email me at curran.kelleher@gmail.com.

## Workflow

The script `server.js` implements a simple static file server for development use. It is convenient to serve the examples locally during development.

 * to install required NPM packages, run `npm install`
 * launch a local development server by running `node server.js`
 * navigate to [http://localhost:8000/#/](http://localhost:8000/#/) to view what will be shown at [http://curran.github.io/model-contrib/#/](http://curran.github.io/model-contrib/#/)

After adding an example or module, you can update the home page Angular app and screenshots with the following steps:

 * run `gulp`, which will run the code through JSHint and create the Docco documentation for all examples (under `docs`).
 * run `node buildIndex.js`, which creates `index.json`. This data file is the database that powers the [project home page](http://curran.github.io/model-contrib/), which you can access locally at [http://localhost:8000/#/](http://localhost:8000/#/).
 * run `node generateThumbnails.js` to render a thumbnail of each example and puts it under the `thumbnails` directory.
 * refresh [http://localhost:8000/#/](http://localhost:8000/#/) to check that there are no errors in the rendered visualizations.
 * For modules, click on the module entry to check if the Docco documentation for your module looks good.
 * For examples, click on the example entry to check if the example viewer (which renders README.md into HTML) presents the example well.

Improvements to the Angular side of the example code viewer or home page are also welcome.
