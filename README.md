# Contributing

Pull requests welcome! Add modules under `modules` and examples under `examples`. Please put your name and the date (or month) of authorship at the bottom of your example `README.md` file for examples, and at the end of the documentation comments before the code begins for modules.

Improvements to the Angular side of the example code viewer or home page are also welcome.
