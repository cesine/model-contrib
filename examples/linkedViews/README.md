An example of multiple linked views using `model.js`. This builds on two other examples, the [bar chart](http://curran.github.io/model-contrib/#/examples/barChart) and [scatter plot](http://curran.github.io/model-contrib/#/examples/scatterPlot).

Click and drag in the scatter plot to filter the data used as input to the bar chart. The Iris flowers selected as dots within the brushed region are grouped by species and summed to produce the data used as input to the bar chart.
